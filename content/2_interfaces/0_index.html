<p>Pixel Composer interfaces are separated into two types: panels and dialogs. Panels are interface area 
that embed directly to the main windows. Dialogs are floating area that can be move around freely and overlap with other dialogs.</p>
<br>
<h2>Panels</h2>

<br>
<p>The first time you open Pixel Composer. You'll be greeted with 5 panels: menu, graph, preview, inspector and animation panels.</p>
<br>
<p>When hovering on the edge of the active panel, the edge will be highlighted. This means that panel can be manipulated as below:</p>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><p>Resize: Click and drag the edge to resize the panel.</p></li>
    <li><p>Move: Double click and drag the edge to move the panel somewhere else.</p></li>
    <li><p>Detach: Hold shift + Double click to detach the panel, transforming it to dialog.</p></li>
    <li><p>Close: Right click on the edeg and select "close"</p>.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Right clicking on the edge while hovering will also bring up context menu with option to move, detach and close the panel as well.</p>

<br>
<p>Most dialogs except color selector are floating type, which means it will close when left clicking outside. Hovering on the edge 
of the dialog will also highlighted the edge which allows for dialog manipulation similiar to panels including right click context menu.</p>
