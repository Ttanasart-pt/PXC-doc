<br>
<p>There're 3 nodes related to lua scripting. <a href="">Lua Global</a>, <a href="">Lua Surface</a>, 
and <a href="">Lua Compute</a> depends of your usecase.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Shell</h2>
<br>
<p>Shell scripting is used to execute command line commands. You can use <a href="">Execute Shell</a> 
node to execute a shell script.</p>
<br>
<p>However, running shell script you don't know can cause damage to your computer. Thus on the first execution, 
a warning dialog will show up to make sure you know what script will be executed.</p>
