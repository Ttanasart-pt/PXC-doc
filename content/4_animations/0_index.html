<h1>Animations</h1>
<br><br>
<p>Pixel Composer use keyframe-based animation. Most properties can be animated using the inspector panel 
and the animation can be view and modify at the animation panel.</p>
<br>
<h2>Animation Basics</h2>
<br>
<h3>Enabling Animation</h3>
<br>
<p>To enable animation, click on the animation icon at the property name in the inspector. Click on it again 
to disable the animation.</p>
<br>
<h3>Adding Keyframe</h3>
<br>
<p>When modifying animated properties. A new keyframe will be created automatically at the current frame. 
You can also create new keyframe by clicking on the keyframe icon on the inspector or animation panel.</p>
<br>
<h3>Removing Keyframe</h3>
<br>
<p>To remove a keyframe, select the keyframe(s) in the animation panel and press the 
<span class="inline-code">Del</span> key.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Keyframe Types</h2>
<br>
<p>By default, all keyframes use linear interpolation. You can change how the value is interpolated by going to 
the animation panel. Select a keyframe and double click and drag horizontally to smoothen the interpolation curve.</p>
<br>
<p>You can also right click on the keyframe and set the interpolation type directly.</p>
<br>
<table class="icon-detail">
    <tr>
        <td><img src="" alt=""></td>
        <td>Linear</td>
        <td>Value changes linearly between keyframes.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="" alt=""></td>
        <td>Smooth</td>
        <td>Value changes following a smooth curve.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><img src="" alt=""></td>
        <td>Hold</td>
        <td>Value changes abruptly between keyframes.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<h2>Animation Curve</h2>
<br>
<p>You can display animation curve in the animation panel by pressing the curve icon at the property name.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Separated Axis</h2>
<br>
<p>For value with array subdata (e.g. Vector, Area, etc.) a keyframe will represent all the member in the array. 
This means you can't animate each member independently. To do so, you need to separate the axis by right-clicking 
on the property in the inspector and select "Separate Axis".</p>
<br>
<p>With separated axis mode on, each member in the array will get their own timeline.</p>
