<h1>Array Processor</h1>
<br><br>
<p>Array Processors are type of nodes that can process array of inputs. This allows you to batch process 
multiple data, or create varient of image with different parameters.</p>
<br>
<p>Node that are array processor will have the [] icon.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Array Processing Types</h2>
<br>
<p>If only one input is an array. Then each value in the array will be applies and output one by one. 
Thus the output will be array of the same size. <br><br>However, if there're multiple array inputs 
(especially with different size), then there're multiple ways the node can process the arrays.</p>
<br>
<p>There are 4 types of array processing which can be change in the settings tab.</p>
<br>
<h3>Loop</h3>
<br>
<p>This is the default behaviour. Loop the shorter array until the longer array is ended. The output will be array 
of the same size as the longer array.</p>
<br>
<h3>Hold</h3>
<br>
<p>Hold the last value of the smaller array until the longer array is ended. The output will be array of the 
same size as the longer array.</p>
<br>
<h3>Expand</h3>
<br>
<p>Create all combination of all input array. The output size will be the multiplication of all array length.</p>
<br>
<h3>Expand Inverse</h3>
<br>
<p>Create all combination of all input array. But reverse the order in which the combination generated. 
The output size will be the multiplication of all array length.</p>
