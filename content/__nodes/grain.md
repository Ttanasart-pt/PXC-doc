## Properties

### <junc blend mode>
The blend mode to apply to the color modification. This can be either additive or multiplicative. 

- **Additive** mode will apply the value equally to the entire surface, giving a more uniform grain.
- **Multiplicative** mode will be more pronounced on the brighter areas (higher value) of the surface.
