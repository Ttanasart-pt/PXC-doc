<p>Bloom effect is an effect where the brighter parts of the image blur and bleed the brightness to the nearby 
pixels.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<br>
<h3><junc size/></h3>
<br>
<p>Size of the blur effect. Larger blur may need to be compensate with high <junc strength/>.</p>
<br>
<h3><junc tolerance/></h3>
<br>
<p>The threshold of the brightness that will be affected by the bloom effect. Lower tolerance will make more 
pixels to be affected by the bloom effect.</p>
<br>
<h3><junc strength/></h3>
<br>
<p>Strength, intensity of the additive bloom layer.</p>
<br>
<h3><junc bloom mask/></h3>
<br>
<p>An additional surface that use to control the bloom amount per pixel. The brightness of the mask will 
be multiplied to the bloom to create final bloom amount.</p>
