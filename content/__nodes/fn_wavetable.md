Generate different type of periodic waveforms.

## Properties

### <junc pattern>
The type of waveform to generate. This is define by a float that blend between the following waveforms:

- 0: Sine wave
- 1: Square wave
- 2: Sawtooth wave

### <junc range>
Amplitude of the waveform in form of minimum - maximum value.

### <junc frequency>
Frequency of the waveform in revolution/animation.
