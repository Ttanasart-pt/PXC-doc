<h2>Stacking Positions</h2>
<br>
<p>When stacking, each copy will be shifted by the amount set by the <junc Stack shift> properties. 
The final position can also be adjusted by the <junc Position>.</p>
<br>
<p>The <junc Move base> property will revert the position such that the original image 
got shifted instead of the copies.</p>
