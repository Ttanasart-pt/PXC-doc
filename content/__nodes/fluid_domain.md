Create smoke simulation domain.

## Properties

### <junc dimension>
Size of the domain.

### <junc wrap>
Wrap the domain around the edges.

### <junc collision>
A surface defining the solid part of the domain.

### <junc initial pressure>
Pressure, density of the empty space.

### <junc acceleration>
Global acceleration.

### <junc material intertia> (typo)
How much the material resists to change its velocity.

### <junc material dissipation>
How much the material spreads out to empty space.

### <junc velocity dissipation>
How much the velocity spreads out to equilibrium.

### Huh?
This section contains properties that I have no idea what it does so just ignore it.
