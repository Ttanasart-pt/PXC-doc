Iterate through the input array and sort the elements based on the condition defined by node graph. The sorting is done by checking 2 value whether to swap or not. 

For example, if you want to sort array of number in ascending order, you can check the return value of a <node compare> node with the condition `a > b`. If the return value is true, the two value will be swapped, thus putting the smaller value in front of the larger one.
