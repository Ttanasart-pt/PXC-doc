<p>Armature Pose takes a bone structure defined by the <node armature> node and transform them.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Posing</h2>
<br>
<p>Bone created by the <node armature> node can't be animated by itself and consider as the "rest" position. Armature Pose can 
transform and animated them in the preview panel:</p>
<br>
<table class="cc4060">
    <tr>
        <th>Property</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rotation</td>
        <td>Click and drag on the bone</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Translation</td>
        <td>Click and drag the origin (only a parent or a detached bone can be move)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Scale</td>
        <td>Click and drag the end point of the bone</td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br><br>
<h2>Animation</h2>
<br>
<p>Animation can be toggle in the inspector just like any other properties. However because all transformation (position, 
rotation, scale) are combines as one property. It's recommended to separate axis when animating to allows for more control.</p>
