<p>Point affector modify array of points by calculating each of it's proximity to an affector.</p>
<br>
<p>This node takes 3 arrays of the same size: Points, Initial value and Final value.</p>
<br>
<img node_3d_point_affectord>
<br>
<p>For each point, it calculate the proximity to an affector, and use that value to blend between the initial 
and final value of the same index.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Preview</h2>
<br>
<p>Point affector comes with 3D controller which allows you to modify the affector in 3D space.</p>

<br>
<h2>Affectors</h2>
<br>
<p>Point affector comes with 2 types of affectors: Sphere and Plane.</p>
<br>
<h3>Sphere</h3>
<br>
<p>Sphere affector influent points based on the distance from the point and the affector center. 
Note that the affector always use uniform scale, if the scale aren't uniform, then the largest value will be used.</p>

<br>
<h3>Plane</h3>
<br>
<p>Plane affector influent points based on the distance from the point and the affector plane.</p>

<br>
<h2>Falloff</h2>
<br>
<p>You can modify how the value transition when it's near the affector using the falloff properties.</p>
