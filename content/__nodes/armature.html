<p>Armature system is a way to create bone-based animation.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Armature Editor</h2>
<br>
<p>The main functionalities of this node is in the preview panel. There're 5 tools in the tool rack:</p>
<br>

<br>
<h3>Adding Bones</h3>
<br>
<p>When using the "Add bones" tools, click and drag on an empty area to add a new parent bone.<br><br>
Click and drag from the end of a bone to create a child.<br><br>Click on a bone to split it.</p>
<br>
<h3>Deleting Bones</h3>
<br>
<p>Select the "Revome bones" and click on a bone you want to delete. Note that deleting a bone with children will 
reattach the children to the parent of the deleted bone, if the deleted bone has no parent, then the children 
will becomes new parents.</p>
<br>
<h3>Detach Bones</h3>
<br>
<p>Detach bones is used to detach a bone from its constrain. This does not mean removing the parent, but 
allowing the bone to move freely. Select the detach bones tool and click on the bone you want to detach.</p>

<h3>Inverse Kinematics</h3>
<br>
<p>Inverse Kinematics (IK) is a way to control the movement of a bone by moving its child. <br><br>Select the IK 
tool, click on the last bone of the chain, that bone will be highlighted with green color, drag it to the first 
bone of the chain and release the mouse. A new IK target object will appear and you can move it to control the chain.</p>

<h2>Armature System</h2>
<br>
<p>This node only create a bone structure, to pose it or attach a surface onto it, you need the <node armature_pose> 
and <node armature_bind> nodes respectively.<br><br>
