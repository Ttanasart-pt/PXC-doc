<p>The process of mapping a 2D image to a 3D model is call UV mapping. This node allow you to remap the UV 
by projecting texture onto the model in world space.</p>

<h2>Subobject</h2>
<br>
<p>For object with multiple textures, each textrue will be assigned to a subobject. This property allow you 
to target a specific subobject to remap the UV insted of all.</p>

<h2>Bake</h2>
