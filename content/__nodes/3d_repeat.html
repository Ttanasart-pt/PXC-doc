<p>3D repeat allows you to create clones of the object with different transformations.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Direct vs. Compound Transformations</h2>
<br>
<p>The transformations of each instances are controlled by 2 values, direct and compound. <br><br>
The direct value apply directly to each object based on its index, there are set by the 
<junc Positions>, <junc Rotations>, and <junc Scales> 
properties. <br><br>
The compound value multiply per each index, e.g. the second object will tranform twice as much as the first object, 
the compound values are controlled by the <junc Shift Position>, <junc Shift Rotation>, and <junc Shift Scale> properties.<br><br>
Both direct and compound transformations are added to create the final transformations.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Object Mode</h2>
<br>
<p>The repeat amount can be set in the <junc Object Mode> property. Duplicate mode 
will allows you to set the amount dierctly. Array mode will set the amount to match the <junc Positions>, <junc Rotations>, 
and <junc Scales> array.</p>
