<p>While you can use any surface as a texture for 3D object, 3D Material nodes allow the creation of material with 
more complex properties.</p>
<br>
<p class="banner">Note that MakhamDev have no idea how 3D works, so these properties may not behave like how other 
3D softwares do.</p>
<br>
<h2>Material Properties</h2>
<br>
<h3>Diffuse</h3>
<br>
<p>Diffuse value simulate the effect of light scattering when in contact with the surface roughtness. Diffuse 
amount won't have any effect if the specular value is set to 0.</p>
<br>
<h3>Specular</h3>
<br>
<p>Specular value simulate the effect of light reflection. The higher the value, the more reflective the surface
will be.</p>

<br>
<h3>Shininess</h3>
<br>
<p>Shininess value control the reflectiveness at different angles. Increasing it will make reflected light more 
directed.</p>

<br>
<h3>Roughness</h3>
<br>
<p>Roughtness control the reflected color of the light. Lower roughtness make the surface reflect more 
background colors.</p>

<h3>Normal</h3>
<br>
<p>Normal map is a texture that modify the surface normal. This can be used to increase the detail of the 
model without increasing the polygon count.</p>
