<p>Render Spritesheet generate a single surface containing frames from animation or array. It is recommended that every frames should 
have the same size.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Input</h2>
<br>
<p>There are 2 types of input set by the <junc sprite set/>: Animation and sprite array.<br><br>When set to animation, the node will 
require full rendering to record all the animation frames. You can also use <junc frame step/> to skip frames for smaller spritesheet.<br><br>
When set to sprite array, the node will runs automatically similiar 
to <node image_grid/>.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Output Properties</h2>
<br>
<h3><junc packing type/></h3>
<br>
<p>Control how the surface is arranged. <span class="inline-code">Horizontal</span> and <span class="inline-code">Vertical</span> mode 
will place the surfaces linearly. <span class="inline-code">Grid</span> will place image in a grid.</p>
<br>
<h3><junc alignment/></h3>
<br>
<p>When the input surfaces has different sizes, <junc alignment/> control where to place the smaller surface:</p>
<br>
<img spritesheet_alignment>
<br>
<h3><junc spacing/></h3>
<br>
<p>Set the space between each surface. If the <junc packing type/> is set to grid, then this value will becomes vec2 for horizontal and 
vertical spacing.</p>
<br>
<h3><junc padding/></h3>
<br>
<p>Add padding space in each direction afterward.</p>
