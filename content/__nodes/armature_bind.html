<p>This node is the "rendering" part of the armature system.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Surface Binding</h2>
<br>
<p>To bind a surface, the first step is to connect that surface to the node.</p>
<br>
<img-deco armature_bind_1>
<br>
<p>The binding stage is done in the inspector. Click and drag the hamburger icon in the left of a surface 
to the bone you want.</p>
<br>
<img-deco armature_bind_2>
<br>
<p>Binded surface will show up next to the bone. A surface can only be binded to one bone.</p>
<br>
<img-deco armature_bind_3>
<br>
<h3>Binding Transformation</h3>
<br>
<p>After the surfaces is binded, it will show up in the preview panel. You can modify the transformation 
of the binded surface in the preview panel.</p>
