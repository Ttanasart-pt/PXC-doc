<p>Line node is used to draw a line (or lines) on a surface.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Path Data</h2>
<br>
<p>Line node takes path data to define the path to draw. Without it, it will draw a single straight line across 
the middle of the surface with the <junc rotation/> value control the angle.<br><br>
The path data can be provided through <junc path/>.</p>
<br>
<img line_path_data/>
<br><br>
<h2>Resolution</h2>
<br>
<p>When drawing a path, line node generate segment of straight lines and combine them together. The more 
segment it generated the more accurate the path will be. There're 2 types of segment generation controlled by 
the <junc fix length/> property.</p>
<br>
<h3>Fix amount</h3>
<br>
<p>By default, <junc fix length/> is set to false. This mean the amount of the segment is being controlled 
directly through the <junc segment/> property./p>
<br>
<img-deco line_fix_amount/>
<br>
<h3>Fix length</h3>
<br>
<p>When <junc fix length/> is set to true, the segment length is being controlled instead. The <junc segment length/>
property will determine the maximum length of each segment in pixel.</p>
<br>

<br><br>
<h2>Line Width</h2>
<br>
<p>Line width can be controlled through the <junc width/> property. This width is a vector containing 2 values, 
the width of each segment will be random bewteen these 2 values. You can set it to the same value to fix the 
length.</p>
<br>
<h3><junc 1px mode/></h3>
<br>
<p>The <junc 1px mode/> toggle will fix the line width to 1 pixel, and use a more pixel perfect algorithm to 
draw the lines.</p>
<br>
<img-deco line_width_1px/>
<br>
<h3><junc width over length/></h3>
<br>
<p>You can modulate the width of the line over it's length using the <junc width over length/> curve. This curve 
will be multiplied with the <junc width/> value to determine the final width.</p>
