<h2>Positioning</h2>
<br>
<p>Directional light will always point to the origin (0, 0, 0), thus, its direction is controlled by the position.</p>

<h2>Shadow</h2>
<br>
<p>Selecting "Cast Shadow" will make the light cast shadow with solid objects. Note that shadow does not works with 
transparent and translucent objects.</p>
<br>
<p>Shadow Map Size and Scale are used to control shadow quality. Shadow Bias can be used to fix glitch with light
bleed around the shadow edges.</p>
