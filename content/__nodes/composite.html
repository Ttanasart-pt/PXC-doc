<p>Composite node allows you to combines multiple surface together.<br><br>It's similiar to <node blend>, but support 
multiple surfaces with only normal blending.</p>

<h2>Output Dimension</h2>
<br>
<p>The <junc Output Dimension/> property control how the output dimension is determined:</p>
<br>
<table class="cc4060">
    <tr>
        <td>First surface</td>
        <td>Dimension is determined by the first surface in the list.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Largest surface</td>
        <td>Dimension is determined by the largest surface in the list.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Constant</td>
        <td>Dimension is determined by the <junc Dimension/></td>
    </tr>
</table>
<br>
<p>The <junc Padding/> add extra spaces in each direction.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Atlas</h2>
<br>
<p><junc Atlas Data/> returns a special type of surface called Atlas. Atlas is a surface with extra metadata 
for its position, rotation, scale, etc. Atlases can be process individually and combine together later.</p>
