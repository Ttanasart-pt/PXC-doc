<p>Audio window takes a sample from audioBit and convert it to array of numbers. <br><br>Windowing mean taking a slice of 
data from larger data set by sampling a small portion of it. This is done to reduce the amount of data to be processed.</p>
<br>

<h2>Window Properties</h2>
<br>
<p>Properties in the window section are used to control the window position and scale. The <junc Width> 
control the size of the window.<br><br>The <junc Location> control the position on the windows.
<br><br>If <junc Match timeline> is selected, then the location will be ties to the 
project animations.</p>
<br>
<h2>Window Output</h2>
<br>
<p>The output of the window is an array of numbers. The size of the array is determined by the <junc Width> 
and <junc Step>. The <junc Step> control the distance between each sample. <br><br>
Thus the final array size will be <junc Width> / <junc Step>.</p>
