<h1>CLI</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p>Pixel Composer supports a number of command line arguments which allow the program to be run headlessly (running without 
user interface).</p>
<br>
<p>However, due to the nature of the software, it cannot output stdout. Which means you can't see any output text 
when running it. To improve user experience, a CLI wrapper is provided as an external .exe that has to be 
<span><a href="https://github.com/Ttanasart-pt/PXC-cli/releases/tag/release">downloaded separately</a></span>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Running .pxc Project</h2>
<br>
<p>Command line operation is used to runs Pixel Composer project with custom values. Which means first you need to have 
Pixel Composer project with export nodes ready. Then you can use this script to runs the project:</p>
<span class="code-block">./[pixelcomposer.exe] [path to project] [tags] [global variables]</span>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<br>
<h3><span class="inline-code">-c, --crashed</span> Crash mode <span class="code-tag unused">unused</span></h3>
<br>
<p>Run Pixel Composer normally but with crash dialog. (Only used by the software itself, no reason to call it manually).</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><span class="inline-code">-h, --headless</span> Runs in headless mode</h3>
<br>
<p>Run Pixel Composer without the user interface. Without this tag Pixel Composer will runs as GUI normally.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><span class="inline-code">-t, --trusted</span> Trust project</h3>
<br>
<p>Allow all shell execute nodes to run. By default all shell execute nodes are disabled when running in headless mode</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><span class="inline-code">-sl, --skiplua</span> Skip lua initialization</h3>
<br>
<p>Skip lua initialization on startup which should improve running speed marginally.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Global Variables</h2>
<br>
<span class="code-block">-name value</span>
<p>After tags, you can provides value to global variables. Use quotation marks to surround text with space inside.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>CLI Wrapper</h2>
<br>
<p>The CLI wrapper comes with text-based user interface and extra tags which allows for persist mode.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><span class="inline-code">-v, --verbose</span> Verbose mode</h3>
<br>
<p>Display output text indicating status and errors.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><span class="inline-code">-p, --persist</span> Persist mode</h3>
<br>
<p>Run Pixel Composer in persist mode. Used with headless mode to keep the program open after running the command.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h3><span class="inline-code">-s, --server [port]</span> Runs as server</h3>
<br>
<p>Run Pixel Composer as a server at the given port value.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Persist Mode</h2>
<br>
<p>Adding the persist tag <span class="inline-code">-p</span> will runs Pixel Composer in persist mode. The project 
will run once and an interactive shell will appear. You can send console commands through this shell.</p>
<p class="banner warning">Persist mode takes <span class="bold">console commands</span> not command line arguments. To see lists of console
commands please check the <a href="./console_command.html">Console Command</a> page.</span></p>
