# Beta participation

The beta branch is a separate branch of the software that is updated more frequently but may contain bugs. It is recommended for users who want to test the latest features and provide feedback to the developers.

The preference folder in `%APPDATA%` is shared between the stable and beta branches, so you should backup the folder before switching between branches.

## Itch

To access the beta branch on Itch, you can simply download the software with "beta" tags in the title and runs normally.

## Steam

To access the beta branch on Steam, you can right-click on the software in your library, select "Properties...", go to the "Betas" tab, and select the beta branch from the dropdown menu.
